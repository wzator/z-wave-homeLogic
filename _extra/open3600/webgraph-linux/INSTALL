You need a webserver with a recent version of PHP including graphical library GD.

A cronjob must fetch data from the station for example every 10 minutes

In /etc/crontab add this line that will run every 10 minutes (assuming that log3600 is installed in /var/www/graph)
*/10 * * * * /var/www/graph/log3600 /var/www/graph/log3600.log

This adds a line of data to /var/www/graph/log3600.log every 10 minutes.
Make sure that the file is world readable.

Place all the files from this package in a directory on your web server.
