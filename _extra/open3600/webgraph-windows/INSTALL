You need a webserver with a recent version of PHP including graphical library GD.

A windows scheduler job must fetch data from the station for example every 10 minutes

In the scheduler add an entry that will run every 10 minutes (assuming that the package is installed in c:\Apache\Apache2\htdocs\graph)
with the following command; "c:\Apache\Apache2\htdocs\graph\log3600.exe c:\Apache\Apache2\htdocs\graph\log3600.log"

This adds a line of data to c:\Apache\Apache2\htdocs\graph\log3600.log every 10 minutes.

Place all the files from this package in a directory on your web server.
